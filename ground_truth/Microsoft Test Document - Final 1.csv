?? Inherent Risk Assessment
Based on the above, the selected account exhibits moderate to high inherent risk due to the following factors:
1. High Volume and Value of Transactions
•	The account shows a net credit of –\$9.7B, indicating substantial revenue activity.
•	High transaction volume (79,000 JEs) increases the risk of errors or irregularities.
2. Manual Adjustments
•	Significant manual entries (–\$153M) and adjustments (\$571M) suggest potential for override or manipulation.
•	Manual entries are often less controlled and more prone to error or fraud.
3. Decline in Fingerprint Diversity
•	A drop in Level 1 and Level 2 JE fingerprints may indicate reduced variability in posting patterns, which could signal automation or consolidation—but also raises concerns about lack of segregation or oversight.
4. Multiple Source Systems
•	With 27 sources contributing, integration and consistency risks are elevated.
•	Disparate systems may lead to reconciliation issues or data integrity concerns.
5. Receivables Adjustments
•	Large negative adjustments (–\$17.8M) in receivables could reflect aggressive revenue recognition or write-offs.
________________________________________
? Recommendations
•	Perform targeted testing on manual and adjustment entries.
•	Review source system mappings and reconciliations for completeness and accuracy.
•	Analyze fingerprint trends to understand changes in posting behavior.
•	Validate cutoff procedures to ensure revenue is recognized in the correct period.
•	Assess segregation of duties across preparers and approvers.

The foundational principle of SoD is that no single individual should control all aspects of a financial transaction, including initiation, authorization, recording, and reconciliation.",,,,,,,,,
